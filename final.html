			<h2> How the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the music industry.</h2>
		<h4> The lack of live music and what was lost and gained as a result.

			<h3>Summary of the Dataset</h3>
		
		<p> For most of the world, COVID-19 is seemingly over. People are back at work, masks are no longer required and people are with each other- not worrying about being 6 feet apart. Many things have been changed forever though, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One of those things that changed is music.</p>

		<p> A main driving force in the entertainment realm is live music. Once concerts were forced to be either canceled, postponed or rescheduled during the pandemic, there was a huge shift in the industry. According to <a href="https://stagemusiccenter.com/music-school-blog-winchester-acton-ma/covid-19-and-the-music-industry/">Stage Music Center</a>, “the global live music concert saw a loss of more than $30 billion in 2020.” However, artists and fans were not the only people affected once the status of these shows changed. COVID-19 affected the venues, promoters, and ticket sales.</p>

		<p> This dataset studies the effect of COVID-19 on scheduled concerts throughout January through July of 2020. The dataset looks at whether the concerts were postponed, rescheduled or canceled, and whether or not a refund was issued.</p> 

		<p> My findings and data are newsworthy because it is important to understand the direct impact COVID had on live music, to understand the long term effects taking place now. Although not all specific details regarding each show are documented, we can get a general understanding of the shows and their significance, and learn what factors determine a show’s standing during a pandemic.</p>

		<p> As seen in this graph, the most concert changes took place in March of 2020, when the pandemic was at its peak. However, this does not count for the following COVID-19 variants like Omicron, Delta, etc. that would occur in the years ahead.</p>

		<h3>The music scene was frozen for months</h3>
		<p>Once COVID-19 picked up in late February of 2020, the status of concerts drastically changed. Up and coming artists who needed live music engagement to grow, were struggling. After a conversation with Geoff Turner, a current booking agent in the Texas music industry at <a href="https://www.wmeagency.com/">William Morris Endeavor</a>, I learned that artists needed to be touring to make a living. “I could sign a young developing act, and there was a formula on how you develop them,” he said. “I had artists on my roster since before the pandemic, that I just could not get started,” he went on to say. Geoff shared that as a booking agent, he would throw his newly signed acts onto every support budget. He shared that because of the pandemic, it’s since been tough to take risks.</p>

			<h3>What happened to all of the tickets sold prior to the event?</h3>
			<p>Before the pandemic hit, people bought their tickets for previously scheduled shows. Promoters pushed very hard to not refund tickets and just carry them over to reschedule. Geoff Turner shared that many ticketing companies were not financed well and held onto money for long periods of time. The relationship between the promoter, artist and ticketing company was incredibly important to determine whether or not a refund would be issued. However, because of the issues with the ticketing companies and the unknown status of the shows, people were not able to be fully refunded for months, or even years at a time.</p>

		<p> How well ticketing companies were financed and collateralized was put to the test during the pandemic. “I still had a show last year that was holding people’s money from a COVID cancellation,” said Geoff. “(There was a) big gray area if you weren't a ticketing company that had a lot of cash on hand.” Geoff shared that “if the pandemic had gone on for another 6 months, a lot of people would be in a lot of worse shape than where they are right now.”</p>

		<h3>A lack of live music allowed for a life of social media</h3>
		<p> During the pandemic is when an entirely new social media trend began to surface. Although Tik Tok had already existed, it wasn’t until the pandemic that artists like Doja Cat and Megan The Stallion became popular. Rachel Soloff, an opinions editor for <a href="https://pittnews.com/article/177654/opinions/opinion-covid-19-ruined-concert-culture//">The Pitt News</a> says that “artists that gained popularity during the pandemic, thanks to TikTok, such as Mitski and Steve Lacy, have both had issues with their fan bases at shows acting extremely rude and not respecting them while they perform.” Although Geoff Turner is primarily focused on the Texas Music scene, which is not as mainstream, he told me he agrees.</p>

		<p> “A lot of people that have buzz on Tik Tok have never performed a show; they’re terrible live and they're not entertainers. They are 3 minute clips and good writers,” he shared. He also told me that “while it's another tool (Tik Tok), there's no one singular marketing thing that's going to make an artist's career.”</p>

		<h3>How the music industry has changed</h3>
		<p> Since the pandemic, the majority of concerts are back to normal, however there have been changes in the types of performers and fans. Prior to the pandemic, ticket sales were already on the rise. However, prices have only skyrocketed since. In fact, Rachel believes that the pandemic was a catalyst in causing issues with money during the pandemic. “Ticketmaster’s dynamic pricing and crazy service fees are feeding into the disparity between fans and artists and creating an even more unhealthy environment around concert culture,” she said. “Ticket prices are taking over the concert industry and changing the amount of artists that are pursuing careers.”</p>

		<p> In conclusion, the pause of live music during the pandemic greatly affected the world of music in general. Even today, we are still seeing changes.</p>

			<h3>Limitations of the observed data</h3>
			<p> A limitation with this dataset could be that this data could have changed since 2020. As Geoff said, one of his shows only recently issued a refund. The data surrounding the refunds being unknown could have been updated or changed.</p>

			<p> Another limitation of this dataset could be that this data is studying concerts all over the world, which could make it a bit messy, as all different countries had different guidelines for concerts. The data may have been cleaner if it only had focused on US concerts.</p>

			<p> Finally, this dataset only focused on the first 7 months of the pandemic. It did not focus on the years before or after the pandemic at all, which had new variants and outbreaks affecting the world. Having more data to compare would allow for interesting conclusions to be made.</p>
